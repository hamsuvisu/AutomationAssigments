Employee Names: "Bharath", "ABC", "XYZ"
Employee IDs: 1234, 1235, 1236
Then, create another class called EmpGroups that contains two arrays to store the employee names and IDs.
Retrieve the data from the Employees class, store it in these arrays, and finally print each employee's name along with their corresponding ID.
Example:
